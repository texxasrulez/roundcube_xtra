meta and shift keys), and all of character, number, punctuation, direction, F1-F12
keys with addition of backspace and delete key + ctrl+enter for send mail.


## Supported roundcube versions

This plugins have a branch for almost each version of common roundcube, see 
irt at [https://github.com/roundcubevnz/roundcube-plugin-keyboard_shortcuts/branches](https://github.com/roundcubevnz/roundcube-plugin-keyboard_shortcuts/branches)

Anyhow: **issues, comments are welcome but are only answered if have a pull request or solution are provided**. 
Beware that pull requests will probably be integrated very slowly of are a stupid feature or does not fix a problem, as additional comments will be waited for.



## Installation

Like any normal Roundcube plugin. Use composer.json or use manual way.

## Legacy

This plugin came to life as an offspring of original
[keyboard_shortcuts](https://github.com/corbosman/keyboard_shortcuts) plugin,
joined by a series of merges of almost all unmerged WORKING changes throughout GitHub.

Remaining parts of keyboard_shortcuts are pending for replacement or rewrite:
- help screen
- .css file
- content in localization/
- content in skins/
