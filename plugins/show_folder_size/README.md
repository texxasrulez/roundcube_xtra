A Roundcube plugin which shows folder size.

## Requirements

I only test this plugin with following environments. Other setup may work with luck.

- PHP: >= `7.1.3`
- Roundcube: `1.3.9`, `1.4.0`
- Supported skins: `Classic`, `Larry`, `Elastic`

If you need support for PHP `5.4` ~ `7.0`, go to the
[php5](https://github.com/jfcherng-roundcube/plugin-show-folder-size/tree/php5)
branch or just let Composer decide the version to be installed. But note that
I am not meant to maintain the `php5` branch because even PHP 5.6 is quite outdated nowadays.

## How to install this plugin in Roundcube

### Install via Composer

This plugin has been published on [Packagist](https://packagist.org) by the name of [jfcherng-roundcube/show-folder-size](https://packagist.org/packages/jfcherng-roundcube/show-folder-size).

1. Go to your `ROUNDCUBE_HOME` (i.e., the root directory of your Roundcube).
2. Run `composer require jfcherng-roundcube/show-folder-size`.
3. If you want to do plugin configuration, copy `config.inc.php.dist` to `config.inc.php` and then edit `config.inc.php`.

### Install manually

1. Create folder `show_folder_size` in `ROUNDCUBE_HOME/plugins` if it does not exist.
2. Copy all plugin files there.
3. If you want to do plugin configuration, copy `config.inc.php.dist` to `config.inc.php` and then edit `config.inc.php`.
4. Edit your Roundcube's config file (`ROUNDCUBE_HOME/config/config.inc.php` or maybe `/etc/roundcube/config.inc.php`), locate `$config['plugins']` and add `'show_folder_size',`.

```php
<?php

// some other codes...

$config['plugins'] = [
    // some other plugins...
    'show_folder_size', // <-- add this line
];
```
